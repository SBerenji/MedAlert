# MedAlerts

## Inspiration

We were inspired to give **patients** and **health care providers** a system to communicate effectively. We wanted an *all-in-one application* to  help busy **health care providers** ensure their **patients** are safe from *missed doses*, *falls*, and *Emergency Room visits*. 


## What it does

All-in-one solution to combine *prescribing* and *medication tracking* together.
Allows the **health care provider** to enter prescriptions, which are filled by the **pharmacist** and then tracked by the **patient**.
Ensure *accountability* through *communication* between **patient** and **health care provider**.
**Prevent** *drug* and *allergy* interactions.
**Prevent** *missed doses*, *falls*, and *Emergency Room visits*.
Provide peace of mind for **family**, **patient**, and **health care provider**.


## How we built it

#### Back-end

For the back-end, node.js, and express.js were used. 

#### Front-end

For the front-end react, tailwind css, tailwind, and mongodb were used.

#### Prototype

Adobe XD was used to build the prototype. We used *10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design* to be sure the prototype was designed for as many users as possible. 
From [NNG](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

#### General 

We also used discord, git, github, foundance, and devpost.

#### Honourable mention

We tried to use django, but it was unsuccessful.


## Challenges we ran into

This was our **first** hackathon together!!!
Brainstorming how the application should function was challenging for us. We had some technical issues in the back end (django). We also had some communication issues which was resolved by improving our **note taking** (please see below) to document our actions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We are **proud** we got together and worked hard over this weekend. We are **proud** to be part of this opportunity and are looking forward to the next chance to join another hackathon.


## What we learned

We learned that making memos and taking notes help **improve communication**.  Having notes also kept us **on track**. This is true any time from the initial brainstorming to the final hand-in. We will make sure we keep memos and notes on all projects we work on in the **future**. 
We also learned that during times of frustration, solutions always come after team discussions. 


## What's next for **MedAlert**

We are hoping that we can make **MedAlert** a reality. We hope to prevent *missed doses*, and *consequent complications*.
